It became the capital of the Indore princely state of the Maratha Holkars, and it was the headquarters of the British Central India Agency and the summer capital of Madhya Bharat (1948–56) state before its incorporation into Madhya Pradesh. Krishnapura chhatris (cenotaphs) situated on the bank of the Khan River are dedicated to the Holkar rulers of the city.
